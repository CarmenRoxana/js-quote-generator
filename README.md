# Javascript Quote Generator

Icons in the project are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) and the background image is from [Hero Patterns](https://www.heropatterns.com).\
The Javascript code makes use of an *async/await* function with *fetch* to get quotes data from the [Forismatic API](https://forismatic.com/en/api/).
